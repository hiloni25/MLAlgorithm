Logistic Regression Algorithm-
Coded logistic Regression Algorithm on Iris Dataset using MLE. In this code, I have only taken into consideration classes Virginica and non-Virginica
For training dataset, I have used features-Sepal length and sepal width and used gradient descent to train the model. 
Learning Rate is tuned to achieve best results. Represented accuracy as well as projected logistic regression graph.

Facial Reconstruction using PCA(Principal Component Analysis Algorithm)
Dataset- Use the attached Face Dataset consisting of 177 face images(256*256 pixels /image)
Applied PCA Algorithm for computing n number of eigenfaces(n = 10,30,50,100,150) and showed curve and reconstruction errors for each case.

K-means Algorithm-
Implemented Kmeans algorithm(EM repitation) on initiliazed points and centeres using Euclidean distance. 
Iterated algorthim till clusters reach convergence.

Neural Networks Algorithm-
Coded neural networks Algorithm on Iris Dataset with ine hidden layer. 
Implemented forward and backward function of neural networks for various activation functions-sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.
